# Intro to Cybersecurity

Welcome to **Intro to Cybersecurity** — a beginner-friendly, hands-on guide designed for absolute newcomers. If you’ve ever wondered how hackers break into systems, how defenders stop them, or how the internet stays secure, this course is your starting point.

This course is written so clearly that even a motivated 16‑year‑old with no technical background can follow along.

2. **Operating Systems** — Linux & Windows fundamentals for cybersecurity.
3. **Security Fundamentals** — encryption, authentication, firewalls, and more.
4. **Threats & Vulnerabilities** — the many ways attackers exploit systems.
5. **Tools & Labs** — an introduction to Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, and others.
6. **The Security Mindset** — how to think like both an attacker and defender.
