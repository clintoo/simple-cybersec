# Cybersecurity Foundations

Welcome to **Cybersecurity Foundations** — a beginner-friendly, hands-on guide designed for absolute newcomers. If you've ever wondered how hackers break into systems, how defenders stop them, or how the internet stays secure, this course is your starting point.

This course is written so clearly that even a motivated 16‑year‑old with no technical background can follow along.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll understand:

1. **Networking Basics** — how devices talk to each other and why that matters.
2. **Operating Systems** — Linux & Windows fundamentals for cybersecurity.
3. **Security Fundamentals** — encryption, authentication, firewalls, and more.
4. **Threats & Vulnerabilities** — the many ways attackers exploit systems.
5. **Tools & Labs** — an introduction to Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, and others.
6. **The Security Mindset** — how to think like both an attacker and defender.
7. **Legal & Ethics** — the rules and responsibilities of practicing cybersecurity.

You'll also complete hands-on labs, capture your first packets, scan local networks, and play simple Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.

## ⚠️ Safety & Legal Notice

!!! warning "Important: Use Responsibly"
Cybersecurity skills are powerful. Use them responsibly:

    * **Do not attack systems you don't own or have permission to test.**
    * Practice only in labs, VMs, and safe environments provided here.
    * Read [Legal & Ethics](modules/07_legal_&_ethics/README.md) before doing hands-on activities.

For safe puzzle practice, we recommend [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), starting with **Bandit**.
