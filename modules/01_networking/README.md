# Module 1: Networking

Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity.  
Before you can defend a system, you need to understand how computers communicate.

---

## 1. What is Networking?

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices so they can share information.  
The Internet itself is the largest network in existence.

## 2. Key Concepts

- **IP Address** ‚Üí A unique identifier for a device on a network.  
  - Example: `192.168.1.1` (IPv4), `2001:db8::1` (IPv6).  
- **MAC Address** ‚Üí Hardware identifier assigned to a network card.  
- **Ports** ‚Üí Virtual ‚Äúdoors‚Äù where services communicate.  
  - Example: Port 80 ‚Üí HTTP, Port 22 ‚Üí SSH.  
- **Protocols** ‚Üí Rules that govern communication.  
  - Example: TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS.

## 3. The OSI Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model describes how data moves through a network.  
It has **7 layers**, each with a specific role:

1. **Physical** ‚Äì Cables, Wi-Fi, hardware.  
2. **Data Link** ‚Äì MAC addresses, switches.  
3. **Network** ‚Äì IP addresses, routers.  
4. **Transport** ‚Äì TCP/UDP, reliable delivery.  
5. **Session** ‚Äì Connections between apps.  
6. **Presentation** ‚Äì Data format (encryption, compression).  
7. **Application** ‚Äì User-facing apps (HTTP, DNS, SMTP).  

üëâ In practice, we often simplify this into the **TCP/IP model (4 layers)**:  
- Application ‚Üí (HTTP, DNS, etc.)  
- Transport ‚Üí (TCP/UDP)  
- Internet ‚Üí (IP addresses, routing)  
- Network Access ‚Üí (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)  

---

## 4. Common Protocols

- **HTTP/HTTPS** ‚Üí Web traffic.  
- **DNS** ‚Üí Converts domain names into IP addresses.  
- **SSH** ‚Üí Secure remote login.  
- **FTP/SFTP** ‚Üí File transfer.  
- **SMTP/IMAP/POP3** ‚Üí Email communication.

## 5. Networking Commands (Linux/macOS/Windows)

Try these commands to explore your network:

```bash
# Check your IP address
ip addr         # Linux
ifconfig        # macOS (or older Linux)
ipconfig        # Windows

# Test connectivity
ping google.com

# Trace the route packets take
traceroute google.com   # Linux/macOS
tracert google.com      # Windows

# View open network connections
netstat -tuln           # Linux/macOS
netstat -an             # Windows
````

## 6. Tools to Know

* **Wireshark** ‚Äì Packet capture and analysis.
* **tcpdump** ‚Äì Command-line packet capture.
* **Nmap** ‚Äì Network scanner (find hosts, open ports, services).

---

## 7. Setup Instructions

### Install Wireshark

* **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install wireshark
  ```
* **macOS:**

  ```bash
  brew install --cask wireshark
  ```
* **Windows:**

  * Download from [wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).

### Install Nmap

* **Linux:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install nmap
  ```
* **macOS:**

  ```bash
  brew install nmap
  ```
* **Windows:**

  * Download installer from [nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html).

## 8. Try It Yourself (Mini Labs)

### üîç Scan your own system with Nmap

```bash
# Scan localhost for open ports
nmap 127.0.0.1
```

### üì° Capture packets with tcpdump

```bash
# Capture first 10 packets on interface eth0
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 10
```
