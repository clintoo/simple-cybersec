# Module 3: Security Fundamentals

Now that you know the basics of networking and operating systems, letâ€™s look at the core principles of **cybersecurity**.  
These are the foundations youâ€™ll use everywhere, whether youâ€™re defending a website, a server, or your own laptop.

---

## 1. The CIA Triad

The three pillars of security:

- **Confidentiality** â†’ Keep information secret.  
  - Example: Encrypting messages so only the right person can read them.  

- **Integrity** â†’ Ensure data is not changed.  
  - Example: Digital signatures, file checksums (e.g., `sha256sum`).  

- **Availability** â†’ Keep systems running.  
  - Example: DDoS protection, redundant servers.

## 2. Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA)

- **Authentication** â†’ Proving who you are (password, fingerprint, etc.).  
- **Authorization** â†’ What you are allowed to do.  
- **Accounting** â†’ Keeping track of actions (logs, audits).  

Example (Linux):
```bash
whoami         # Authentication: which user you are
ls -l /home    # Authorization: what files you can access
last           # Accounting: see login history
````

## 3. Encryption Basics

Encryption scrambles data so only the right key can unlock it.

* **Symmetric Encryption** â†’ Same key to lock and unlock (e.g., AES).
* **Asymmetric Encryption** â†’ Public key locks, private key unlocks (e.g., RSA).
* **Hashing** â†’ One-way function to verify integrity (e.g., SHA-256).

Example: Hash a file (Linux/macOS):

```bash
sha256sum file.txt
```

---

## 4. Firewalls & Defense

* **Firewall** â†’ Blocks or allows traffic based on rules.

  * Windows: *Windows Defender Firewall*.
  * Linux: `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall).

Example (Linux):

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # Allow SSH
sudo ufw status
```

---

## 5. Security Policies

Organizations use rules to stay safe:

* **Password Policies** â†’ Long, complex, rotated.
* **Access Controls** â†’ Principle of least privilege (only give access when needed).
* **Patch Management** â†’ Update software to close vulnerabilities.

---

## 6. Logs and Monitoring

* Logs are records of what happened.
* Examples:

  * **Windows** â†’ Event Viewer.
  * **Linux** â†’ `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog`.
* Monitoring tools:

  * **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** â†’ Collect and analyze logs.

---

## 7. Mini Labs (Try It Yourself)

### ðŸ”‘ Create a Secure Password Hash (Linux)

```bash
# Generate a SHA-256 hash of a password
echo -n "MyPassword123!" | sha256sum
```

### ðŸ”’ Enable and Test a Firewall

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw deny 80/tcp    # Block HTTP
```

Then try to open a website â†’ it should fail.

---

## 8. Tools to Know

* **Wireshark** â†’ Packet capture and analysis.
* **OpenSSL** â†’ Encryption and certificates.
* **Fail2Ban** â†’ Blocks IPs after repeated login failures.
* **SIEM Tools** â†’ Splunk, ELK stack, Graylog.

## Why This Matters

Security fundamentals are like the "grammar" of cybersecurity.
Once you master these, youâ€™ll be able to understand attacks, defend systems, and recognize risks in real-world environments.
