# Operating Systems Security

## Overview

Operating systems form the foundation of all computing environments. Understanding OS security is essential for defending against attacks and implementing proper security controls.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand OS security models and access controls
- Identify common OS vulnerabilities
- Implement basic hardening techniques
- Understand process and memory management security

## Topics Covered

### 1. Operating System Fundamentals
- Windows, Linux, and macOS architectures
- Kernel vs User space
- System calls and APIs
- Boot process security

### 2. Access Control Systems
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- File permissions and ownership

### 3. User and Process Management
- User accounts and groups
- Privilege escalation
- Process isolation
- Service management

### 4. System Hardening
- Patch management
- Unnecessary service removal
- Configuration baselines
- Logging and auditing

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Windows-Specific
- DLL Hijacking
- Registry manipulation
- Windows Services exploitation
- UAC bypass techniques

### Linux-Specific
