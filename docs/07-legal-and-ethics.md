### 3. Ethical Decision-Making Framework

#### Steps for Ethical Analysis
1. **Identify the Problem**: What ethical issue is present?
2. **Identify Stakeholders**: Who could be affected by the decision?
3. **Consider Options**: What alternative actions are available?
4. **Evaluate Consequences**: What are potential outcomes of each option?
5. **Apply Ethical Principles**: How do ethical standards guide the decision?

## Responsible Disclosure

### 1. Vulnerability Disclosure Process

#### Coordinated Disclosure Steps
1. **Discovery**: Identify security vulnerability
2. **Documentation**: Record detailed information about the issue
3. **Initial Contact**: Notify affected organization through proper channels
4. **Confirmation**: Verify vulnerability with the organization
5. **Remediation**: Work with organization to develop fix
6. **Public Disclosure**: Release information after fix is available
7. **Follow-up**: Monitor for proper implementation of fix

#### Disclosure Timelines
- **Standard Timeline**: 90 days from initial notification
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: May require expedited disclosure
- **Complex Issues**: May need extended timeline for proper remediation
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Special handling for actively exploited vulnerabilities

### 2. Bug Bounty Programs

#### Program Guidelines
- Follow program scope and rules
- Report only to designated channels
- Avoid accessing sensitive data
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Respect program timelines and processes

#### Legal Protections
- Safe Harbor provisions in program terms
- Legal protections for authorized testing
- Clear boundaries for acceptable testing
- Documentation of testing authorization

## Legal Boundaries in Security Testing

### 1. Authorization Requirements

- Open source projects with security testing policies
- Academic research with proper approvals

### 2. Testing Limitations

#### Scope Restrictions
- Only test systems within defined scope
- Avoid collateral damage to other systems
- Respect data privacy and confidentiality
- Follow specified testing methodologies

#### Common Legal Pitfalls
- **Unauthorized Access**: Testing without proper permission
- **Exceeding Scope**: Going beyond authorized testing boundaries
- **Data Access**: Viewing or copying sensitive information
- **System Damage**: Causing availability or integrity issues

## International Considerations
