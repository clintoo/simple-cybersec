   new_hash, new_data = hashpumpy.hashpump(
       original_hash, original_data, append_data, len(original_data)
   )
   ```

### Binary Exploitation Basics

   for i in range(1, 1000):
       payload = "A" * i
       try:
           result = subprocess.run(["./vulnerable_program", payload], 
                                 capture_output=True, timeout=5)
           if result.returncode != 0:
               print(f"Crash at {i} bytes")
               break
