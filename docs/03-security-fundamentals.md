# Security Fundamentals

## Overview

This module introduces the core principles and concepts that underpin all cybersecurity practices. These fundamentals provide the framework for understanding more advanced security topics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the CIA triad and its applications
- Identify fundamental security principles
- Recognize risk management concepts
- Apply basic security controls

## Core Security Principles

### 1. The CIA Triad

#### Confidentiality
- Information should be accessible only to authorized users
- Implemented through encryption, access controls, and authentication
- Examples: Data encryption, user permissions, VPNs

#### Integrity
- Information must remain accurate and unaltered
- Implemented through checksums, digital signatures, and version control
- Examples: Hash functions, digital certificates, backup systems

#### Availability
- Information and systems must be accessible when needed
- Implemented through redundancy, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery
- Examples: Load balancing, backup systems, incident response

### 2. Additional Security Principles

#### Authentication
- Verifying the identity of users or systems
- Something you know (passwords)
- Something you have (tokens)
- Something you are (biometrics)

#### Authorization
- Granting appropriate access rights to authenticated users
- Based on roles, responsibilities, and need-to-know

#### Non-repudiation
- Preventing denial of actions or transactions
- Digital signatures and audit logs

#### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Reduces single points of failure

#### Principle of Least Privilege
- Users receive minimum access necessary for their role
- Reduces potential damage from compromised accounts

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Process
1. Asset identification
2. Threat identification
3. Vulnerability assessment
4. Impact analysis
5. Risk calculation

### Risk Treatment Options
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor the risk
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the activity causing the risk
- **Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce risk
- **Transfer**: Share or shift risk to others (insurance)

## Security Controls

### Types of Controls
- **Preventive**: Stop security incidents from occurring
- **Detective**: Identify when incidents have occurred
- **Corrective**: Respond to and recover from incidents

### Control Categories
- **Administrative**: Policies, procedures, training
- **Technical**: Firewalls, encryption, access controls
- **Physical**: Locks, guards, environmental controls

## Compliance and Standards

### Common Frameworks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001/27002
- COBIT
- COSO

### Regulatory Requirements
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

## Security Governance

- Security policies and procedures
- Incident response planning
- Business continuity and disaster recovery
- Security awareness training
